# Workflow
## 1. Filter SNPs (only homozygous SNPs with good mapping quality and coverage were remained)
```
sh filter.sh /path/to/snp/file /path/to/genome/reference
```

## 2. Compare SNPs among samples (all common SNPs were deleted)
```
perl /path/to/Bulk-Segregation-Analysis/QSBSA.pl -f=/SNPs/to/filter -v=/samples/to/compare -o=prefix
```
